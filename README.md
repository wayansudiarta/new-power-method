# New Power Method for Eigenvalue Problems

This repository provides supporting files used in our publication: I Wayan Sudiarta and Hadi Susanto (2022), "New Power iteration for Solving Eigenvalue Problems", ArXiv publications.

The new power method is used to determine eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the eigen equation:

$$ \hat{H} \psi = E \psi $$

The files will be added after the paper has been published. Currently in the proses of submission. Thank you for visiting our repository.
